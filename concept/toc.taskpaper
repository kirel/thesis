ToC:
	- Motivation
		What's the problem and how do I want to solve it.
	- Contents
		- Hand drawn symbol recognition (research overview)
			look at symbol recognition in general and mathematical symbol recognition in particular
			might be integrated into classifier evaluation
		- detexify
			- architecture frontend <- http -> backend
				justify choice ~> easy updates etc.
			- frontend
				screens, description of interaction
				- web based interface
				- crowd-sourced classifier training
				- interactive approach instead on automatic classification
			- backend
				- classifier server
			- conclusion ~> classifier evaluation
				incremental training -> adaptive classifier
		- preprocessing strokes
			- normalization
		- classifier evaluation
			- neural nets?
			- hmm?
			- svm?
			- knn
			- combinations
				Does it even make sense?
		- distance measures
			- euclidean distance
			- dynamic time warping
				- unconstrained
				- constrained
					- normalization for cdtw
				- application to stroke recognition
				- optimization through lower bounding 
					and why it doesn't work in 2D
		- feature selection
		- benchmarks (geh√∂rt zur evaluation?)
	- Summary and Outlook
		imagine a wysywym formula editor?
		desktop application invoked by a hotkey?tw
	- Appendix
		- program manual
		- program listings
		- web technologies explained
		- detexify usage statistics
